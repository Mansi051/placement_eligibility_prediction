# Placement_Eligibility_Prediction
This project predicts whether a student is eligible for placement or not using logistic regression machine learning model on the basis of cgpa and number of backlogs.
# Approach

- A Logistic Regression model is trained using CGPA and backlogs as features.

- Since placement criteria are hard business rules, rule-based filtering is applied before model prediction.

- This hybrid approach (Rules + ML) ensures:

    -Correct eligibility decisions

    -Realistic industry-style implementation
